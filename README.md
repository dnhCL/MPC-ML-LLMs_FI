# MPC-ML-LLMs_FI

This repository explores a progressive learning journey across three phases:

1. **Model Predictive Control (MPC / OCP)** applied to residential HVAC systems with heat pumps and batteries.
2. **Machine Learning Forecasting** for demand, temperature, renewable generation, and energy prices.
3. **Large Language Models (LLMs)** as assistants for controller tuning, constraint generation, and documentation.

The aim is to provide an **open-source, reproducible, and educational framework**, suitable for experimentation and practice towards doctoral-level research.

## Repository structure (Phase I)
- `src/` — modular source code (`models/`, `mpc/`, `sim/`, `utils/`).
- `configs/` — YAML configuration files for experiments.
- `data/` — open datasets (raw, processed, external) with loaders.
- `notebooks/` — interactive tutorials and simulations.
- `tests/` — minimal reproducibility tests.
- `docs/` — data cards, guides, and learning material.
- `experiments/` — results, metrics, and figures.

## Licence
This project is fully open source. All datasets and external resources used are restricted to **open licences only** (e.g. CC-BY, MIT, ODbL).
